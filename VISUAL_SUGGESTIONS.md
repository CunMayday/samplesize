# Suggested Visual Enhancements for `samplev2.html`

To make the sample size comparison experience more informative and engaging, consider adding the following visual elements:

## 1. Conversion Lift Over Sample Size
- **Chart Type:** Multi-line chart (Group A vs. Group B).
- **What it Shows:** Estimated conversion rate or open rate lift as sample size grows, using the configured rates.
- **Why it Helps:** Highlights how uncertainty narrows with larger samples and where meaningful divergence appears.
- **Implementation Notes:** Use the existing controls to update lines in real time as users adjust rates and sample sizes.

## 2. Confidence Interval Bands
- **Chart Type:** Line chart with shaded confidence interval bands.
- **What it Shows:** Upper and lower bounds for each group's conversion rate based on the selected confidence level.
- **Why it Helps:** Communicates statistical uncertainty visually and ties directly to the confidence slider.
- **Implementation Notes:** Overlay translucent bands behind each group's conversion rate line; recompute intervals when inputs change.

## 3. Required Sample Size vs. Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)
- **Chart Type:** Heatmap or contour plot.
- **What it Shows:** Estimated required sample sizes across a grid of MDE values.
- **Why it Helps:** Allows quick scanning to understand how ambitious changes affect needed sample sizes.
- **Implementation Notes:** Precompute a modest grid (e.g., 5x5) for performance; highlight the point corresponding to current inputs.

## 4. Outcome Distribution Simulation
- **Chart Type:** Overlapping histograms or density plots from simulated outcomes.
- **What it Shows:** Distribution of potential observed lifts based on Monte Carlo simulation.
- **Why it Helps:** Gives an intuitive feel for variability and overlap between groups.
- **Implementation Notes:** Use lightweight sampling (e.g., 1,000 trials) triggered on demand to avoid performance issues.

## 5. Decision Support Indicator
- **Chart Type:** Gauge or bullet chart.
- **What it Shows:** Probability that Group B outperforms Group A beyond a chosen threshold.
- **Why it Helps:** Distills statistical output into a decision-oriented metric.
- **Implementation Notes:** Derive the probability from simulation or analytic approximations; show color bands (red/amber/green) for quick interpretation.

These additions can be implemented incrementally, starting with simpler line charts before introducing simulations or heatmaps. Each visualization should react to user inputs to keep the dashboard interactive and educational.
